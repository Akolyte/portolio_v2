As of today, I have graduated from the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign with a 4.00 GPA! After countless nights after work spent on assignments, test, and coding I am finally done.

I am really happy and proud of this accomplishment, especially since I graduated from an engineering college and in good standing. That being said this is only another beginning. I look forward to continue picking up new skills, and becoming the best developer, coworker, and contributor that I can be!
