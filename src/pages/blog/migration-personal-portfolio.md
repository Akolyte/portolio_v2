The date is now March 2nd, 2025. After having worked as an AI/ML Engineer at GM for about a year and a half, I feel that my portfolio could use a little sprucing up. Hence I have migrated it from Github Pages and the Jekyll framework, and I will now be using the Astro framework, and deploying using Netlify!

Honestly this has been a long time coming. I have become a lot more comftorable with TypeScript frameworks. While I use Angular and React at work, I feel that it is time to try some new stuff. Plus this [template](https://github.com/RATIU5/zaggonaut) is really cool!

If you're curious, [this](https://akolyte.github.io/) is the link to my previous website.
