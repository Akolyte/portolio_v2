After working at GM for two years as a Software Engineer, I have recently been transfered to work as an AI/ML Engineer. I will be supporting General Motor's transition to cloud infrastructure from on-prem. I will also be deploying and managing machine learning models and data pipelines.

This opportunity would not have come had I not completed my Masters recently. I am really happy that I took proactive steps to advance my career, and I am looking forward to what the future holds in this new role!
