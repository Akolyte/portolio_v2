Hey! Time for another update.

Life has been so insanely busy due to me getting into the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign! I have enrolled in the Grainger College of Engineering's Master's in Computer Science online program. At this time I have just completed my first semester and managed to start with a 4.00 GPA.

The last 4 months were probably the busiest I have ever been in my entire life. Going into it I wasn't sure what to expect with juggling both a full time job and doing my masters online. There were some weeks where I felt like I was truly grinding the entirety of the day. But I persevered, and was able to keep on top of both at the same time.

As far as the Summer goes, I would have liked to take more classes, but I figured this would be a good time to get my finances in order. After all school is expensive! That's all for now, till next time!
