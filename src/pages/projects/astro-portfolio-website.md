I've been doing a lot of more advanced web development at work, so I figured I could explore some more modern frameworks in my spare time.

I stumbled across Astro, and I really enjoyed the straightfoward TypeScript injection into files, and how straightfoward the framework is overall. Therefore, I have now migrated my entire portfolio website to Astro! I'm looking forward to adding more features to the website in the future, so stay tuned!

If you're curious, [this](https://akolyte.github.io/) is the link to my previous website.
